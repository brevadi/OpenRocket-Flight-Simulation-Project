# Learning the application
  - Installing the Application
  - Making a simple rocket and seeing how the application works
  - The inner tube is where the motor is mounted | It should be bigger than the motor (common sense)
  - Bulkhead is added to seal the nose cone so that the charge from the motor does not blow off the nose cone

# Motor specs
  - Configuration: HP-H195NT
  - Ejection charge delay: 10 // (creates a pressure in the body tube that ejects the nose cone and the recovery system                                       from the front of the rocket)
  - Motor type: Single-use
  - Launch mass: 197 g | Empty mass: 82 g
  - Propellant: New Blue Thunder// (Blue Thunder(T) - Produces a bright violet-blue flame with a minimum of exhaust smoke)
  - Diameter: 29 mm
  - Length: 203 mm / 20.3 cm
